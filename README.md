# Natas Wargame

**CAREFUL SPOILERS!**

These are my solutions for the natas wargame. You can read more about the wargames at [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/). [Natas](http://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) is a wargame about server-side web security. You can read more about them in the links.

My solutions are either in bash or in Perl, except two levels which I solved in PHP. You can look through them. I strongly encourage you to try to play the levels themselves. Most of the time, I don't actually explain the code. This game is no fun as a script kiddie. It's OK to look at other people's code (I did that, too), but it's only fun if you actually understand the code and the security issues you exploit. That's what this game is for. So go ahead, have lots of !!FUN!!.

I want to give special thanks [Mike Doherty](https://github.com/doherty/Hack-Natas), whose scripts introduced me to the wargame and helped me get a feeling for how to do this.
